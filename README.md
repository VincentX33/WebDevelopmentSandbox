# WebDevelopmentSandbox
A repo where I try out all the new tricks I pick up in frontend web development. 
Basically a `sandbox`, storing all code in a safe place where I can later refer to it 
in case I forget how I managed a particular task. 
Each folder will have a unique task folder. Will try to ensure it is easy to
navigate.
